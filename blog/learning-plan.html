    <h2><b>Learning Plan</b></h2>
    <h5>10/09/2021</h5>
    <h4 class="blog-h4">Short-Term Goals</h4>
    <p>Over the course of foundations and bootcamp I would like to have a very clear understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript and start learning a new web development framework such as React or even app-specific platforms like Swift etc.</p>
    <p>Following the bootcamp, I would ideally land a position at a forward thinking company that has high workplace values. This may be in web development or something closer to home related to my degree in Electronic Engineering.</p>
    <p>Making note of that, I’d also like to develop some high-profile projects that integrate my learning both from University and Dev Academy that I can put into a portfolio and show to prospective employers. This was something I felt was lacking from my University experience.</p>
    <h4 class="blog-h4">Long-Term Goals</h4>
    <p>I have never known where I see myself 5 years ahead. I’d like to think that I’m still working in an industry where I’m applying the innovative concepts of the software industry to some sort of product, or project, that is actively improving the world. Whether that be from a position geared towards management or a technical role is unknown. I just really like to think that I’m actively providing something to the world rather than earning pay-check to pay-check working in some menial job.</p>
    <p>Come to mention it, I have a passion for education and spreading knowledge. I’ve been a martial arts instructor up until recently (COVID), and I find it is something that brings me joy and it also helps me learn better for myself. So perhaps that is something worth pursuing in the future, whatever industry I find myself in.</p>
    <h4 class="blog-h4">My Commitments</h4>
    <p>I’ve struggled in the past with self-management so this is something that I would really like to develop while at Dev Academy. I believe a structured working routine that incorporates my free time as well would do me wonders. This would mean incorporating time for the gym and leisure activities. I’ve always been an all or nothing person, all work no play, or all play and no work. It’s a toxic balance that I would like to correct while doing Foundations and Bootcamp.</p>
    <p>Thanks for having a look into my learning goals for Dev Academy! Here's some photos of my and my partner's animals!</p>
